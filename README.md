Pathbuilder custom pack for the way of the trickster pf2e expansion.

# Known problems:
Trickster Spells line of feats are replacing previous focus spells rather than adding a new focus spell. For example if you take Advanced Trickster Focus Spells and take Disappearing Act spell, then later on get Greater Trickster Focus Spells and take Stage Illusions, the Stage Illusions spell will replace Disappearing Act rather than you having both options. This problem exists when taking the same feat again as well.
